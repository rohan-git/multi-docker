[![Build Status](https://rohan-git.semaphoreci.com/badges/multi-docker/branches/master.svg?style=shields)](https://rohan-git.semaphoreci.com/projects/multi-docker)

Issues during creation:--

NGNIX
- No spacing should exist between "server client:port"

SEMAPHORE
- Use the same step for building and pushing to Docker etc...
- Semaphore seems to discard the build
